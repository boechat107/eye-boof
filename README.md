# eye-boof

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/boechat107/eye-boof.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/boechat107/eye-boof)

This is a Clojure wrapper for the image processing library [BoofCV](http://boofcv.org/).
Some algorithms, not implemented in BoofCV, are implemented in Clojure using the
BoofCV data structures.

## Installation

The newest version of the library, `[org.clojars.boechat107/eye-boof "1.0.0"]`, is
not compatible with the older versions. A lot of modifications and simplifications
were made! It is better to forget about the previous versions.

## Features

* We are trying to provide wrappers for most of algorithms of 
[BoofCV](http://boofcv.org/index.php?title=Manual).

## Usage

Most of times we need to work with images that already exist, such files in the
disk. So, to load a file from the disk, we write something like

```clojure
(require '[eye-boof.core :refer :all]
         '[eye-boof.io :refer :all]
         '[eye-boof.visualize :refer [view]])

(def color-img (-> "http://png-3.vector.me/files/images/8/0/807142/realistic_vector_eye_thumb.jpg"
                   (java.net.URL.)
                   (load-image)))

;; Visualize the image:
(view color-img)
 
 color-img
;; @@
;; =>
;;; #<MultiSpectral boofcv.struct.image.MultiSpectral@15a27b54>
;; <=
```
![color eye](http://png-3.vector.me/files/images/8/0/807142/realistic_vector_eye_thumb.jpg)

Note that a `MultiSpectral` data structure is returned, which is the common data structure
to store the pixels' intensities of color images. To know how many color channels this
image holds, we can type

```clojure
(nbands color-img)
;; @@
;; =>
;;; 3
;; <=
```

what probably means a RGB image. To take a grayscale version of the image, we can take one of the color bands, like the Red:

```clojure
(band color-img 0)
;; @@
;; =>
;;; #<ImageUInt8 boofcv.struct.image.ImageUInt8@6be86f52>
;; <=
```

![red channel](http://i58.tinypic.com/slgrdj.png)

Other way of doing this is taking the average of the RGB pixel values

```clojure
(average-band color-img)
;; @@
;; =>
;;; #<ImageUInt8 boofcv.struct.image.ImageUInt8@80ac97f>
;; <=
```

To save an image into a disk file, we can use the function `save-image!`
from the `eye-boof.io` namespace. The string path of the file tells the format
representation of the image, like `jpg` or `png` for example. The supported
formats are the same supported by `javax.imageio.ImageIO`, the underlying class
to read/write image files.

```clojure
(save-image! color-img "color_eye.jpg")
;; @@
;; =>
;;; true
;; <=
```
